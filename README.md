# Introducing Agora

Agora is built on the belief that the strength of a network lies in the number of nodes exchanging information within the network. With this in mind, we've set out to create the world's most effective open source AI research organization by integrating millions of developers into our research projects.


## Our master plan is quite simple:

* Initiate: Launch projects with the potential for massive impact, such as creating new foundation models, platforms, and infrastructure.

* Collaborate: Work with enterprises and individuals to solve their most pressing obstacles.

* Optimize, Fine-tune, and Deploy then Iterate quickly: Transform experimental research into seamless and delightful experiences that customers love.


# Active Projects:

We have 30+ active projects, with the most potentially impactful ones listed below. Our main research directions include advancing multi-modality AI reasoning, understanding, and capabilities through multi-modality generation.
